        <h3>The 28th best caramel apple crisp</h3>
        <p>This was another recipe by my late grandma, we used to have it every time we visited, I didn't inherit this recipe though, it's my sister's but I stole the recipe slip</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Half a cup of caramel topping</li>
            <li>Half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Six large baking apples, peeled and cut into half inch slices</li>
            <li>Two thirds of a cup of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Half a cup of packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>Half a cup of cold butter, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>Two thirds of a cup of quick cooking oats</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F</li>
            <li>Stir the caramel topping and cinnamon together in a bowl. Toss in the apples, mixing until evenly coated. Spread apple mixture into an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
            <li>Mix flour and brown sugar into the same bowl used to mix the apples. Cut in the butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the oats, then crumble over the apples.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the apples are tender and the topping is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
