        <h3>The 2943rd best flan you'll ever try!</h3>
        <p>This flan recipe was originally supposed to go to me along with the banana pudding recipe, but instead it was given to my brother since I changed granny's will a bit so I can get the 20 thousand dollar inheritance. As you can see I ended up stealing the recipe slip from my brother anyways</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Three fourths of a cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>1 package of cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>1 can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 can of evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
            <li>In a small, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, cook sugar, stirring, until golden. Pour into a 10 inch round baking dish, tilting to coat bottom and sides. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until well incorporated. Beat in condensed and evaporated milk and vanilla until smooth. Pour into caramel coated pan. Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel. Place baking dish on towel, inside roasting pan, and place roasting pan on oven rack. Fill roasting pan with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven 50 to 60 minutes, until center is just set. Cool one hour on wire rack, then chill in refrigerator 8 hours or overnight. To unmold, run a knife around edges of pan and invert on a rimmed serving platter.</li>
