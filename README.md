This is the first HTML Project assigned by The Odin Project.

It will demonstrate my ability to use very basic HTML to create a recipe website. It will also show my ability to setup a Git repository, clone it, and make commits. The website will include headers, paragraphs, lists, images, and links. No CSS nor JS will be used as this is only a basic HTML project.
